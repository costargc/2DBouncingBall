# Sinai Billard with 2DBouncing Ball on ball
This code was based on the simplified version found in http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/15inout/BouncingBall.java but 
upgraded to include proper physics using the Euler step method.

The idea is to use this as a live demo refecence for Prof. Dr. Mário José de Oliveira seminar on 
"Equipartição da Energia, Bilhar de Sinai e Movimento Browniano" found in http://fig.if.usp.br/~oliveira/perrin.pdf
