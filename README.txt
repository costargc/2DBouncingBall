# Sinai Billard with 2DBouncing Ball on ball
This code was based on the simplified version found in http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/15inout/BouncingBall.java but 
upgraded to include proper physics on ball to ball elastic collisions using the Euler step method.

The idea is to use this as a live demo refecence for Prof. Dr. Mário José de Oliveira seminar on 
"Equipartição da Energia, Bilhar de Sinai e Movimento Browniano" found in http://fig.if.usp.br/~oliveira/perrin.pdf

#Future...
note for the future - it would be interesting to try to do the same using Runge-Kutta... :)
